      Hello curious fellow, this is Joydeep. So as you have tried to view the
      source, I would like to demotivate you. Sorry you can't understand this app
      even if you are a pro JavaScript developer. Okay, let me make it clear, this
      app uses React JS with webpack, so all the source code is bundled in the
      bellow file, of size ~1Mb. If you are really curious about the code, ping me.
      I will give you the source code.
